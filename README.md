## Installation
It is necessary to install the researchpy library to run the code. The python version must be >= 3.9.

## Project Motivation
This project corresponds to the final project from the course of the Data Scientist nanodegree program (Udacity). 

This project uses Cardiotocograms (CTGs) data containing fetal health information and machine learning to indentify cases where there might be issues with the babyâ€™s health allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.

## File descriptions
- README.md: This readme file
- final_project.ipynb: jupyter notebook with the code 
- data/fetal_health.csv: data
